# Project Requirements

## Project Overview
- **Purpose**: The application aims to help users organize their tasks and ideas using mind maps, integrating task management with a visual representation of concepts and notes.
- **Target Audience**: The app is designed for individuals and teams looking to enhance productivity and organization through visual task management.

## Core Features

### Mind Map Creation
The mind map feature will be developed using Three.js to create an interactive 3D environment where users can visualize and organize their tasks and ideas. The design and functionality will be inspired by the visual reference provided in `mindmap-example.png` and the existing code in `MindMap3D.svelte`. Key aspects of the mind map creation include:

- **3D Visualization**: The mind map will be rendered in a 3D space, allowing users to navigate and interact with nodes using intuitive controls. This will be achieved using Three.js, a powerful library for 3D graphics in the browser.

- **Node Structure**: Nodes will represent tasks, concepts, or notes. Each node will have properties such as position (x, y, z coordinates), title, description, and type (e.g., 'concept' for central nodes and 'note' for child nodes). Nodes will be visually represented as spheres, with central nodes being larger and distinct in color.

- **Interactivity**: Users will be able to drag nodes to reposition them, with real-time updates to the connections (branches) between nodes. The `OrbitControls` and `DragControls` from Three.js will be used to facilitate smooth navigation and interaction.

- **Branching and Relationships**: Nodes will be connected by branches, which are dynamically generated using bezier curves to create organic-looking connections. The branches will update automatically as nodes are moved, maintaining the hierarchical structure of the mind map.

- **User Interface Integration**: A modal form will allow users to edit node details such as title, description, and type. This form will be accessible via double-clicking a node or using a dedicated edit button, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- **Accessibility and Usability**: The mind map will support keyboard navigation and include ARIA labels for accessibility. The design will be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.

- **Real-time Collaboration**: The mind map will support real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on the same map simultaneously. This will be implemented using Supabase's real-time capabilities, ensuring that changes are synchronized across all users.

- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering and interaction handling will be prioritized to ensure smooth performance, even with complex mind maps. Techniques such as geometry instancing and optimized event handling will be employed.

By leveraging Three.js and integrating with the existing Svelte components, the mind map feature will provide a rich, interactive experience for users, enhancing their ability to organize and visualize their ideas effectively.

### Task Management
Integrate task tracking within mind maps, allowing users to manage tasks visually.

### User Authentication
Secure user login and registration using Supabase Auth.

### Real-time Collaboration
Allow multiple users to collaborate on mind maps in real-time.

### Cross-Platform Support
Develop the app for both web and iOS platforms.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn-Svelte for UI components.
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication and PostgreSQL database.
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare for web hosting.
- **Mobile**: Considerations for an iOS app with similar functionality.

## User Interface Design
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app is usable on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Accessibility**: Implement features like keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and high contrast modes to make the app accessible to all users.

## Development Stages
- **Stage 1: Setup and Configuration**
  - Set up the development environment with SvelteKit and Supabase.
  - Configure Tailwind CSS and Shadcn-Svelte for UI development.
- **Stage 2: Core Features Implementation**
  - Develop the mind map creation and task management features.
  - Implement user authentication and session management.
- **Stage 3: Real-time Collaboration**
  - Integrate real-time updates using Supabase's real-time capabilities.
- **Stage 4: Cross-Platform Development**
  - Adapt the web app for iOS using a framework like Capacitor or React Native.
- **Stage 5: Testing and Deployment**
  - Conduct thorough testing on both web and iOS platforms.
  - Deploy the web app on Cloudflare and prepare the iOS app for App Store submission.

## Future Enhancements
- **AI Integration**: Explore AI features to suggest task prioritization or mind map organization.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Provide users with insights into their productivity and task completion trends.

## Documentation and Support
- Maintain comprehensive documentation for developers and users.
- Provide support channels for user feedback and issue resolution.
