### 2024-03-20

#### What was done:
- Fixed parent-child relationship persistence in database
- Identified next steps for TOIT implementation

#### Next steps:
1. Enhance node data structure to support TOIT concepts:
   - Add status field (pending, in_progress, completed)
   - Add estimated duration field
   - Add priority field
   - Add tags/categories

2. UI Improvements:
   - Create modal form for editing node details
   - Add visual indicators for node status
   - Implement node filtering by status/category

3. Task Management Features:
   - Implement task splitting functionality
   - Add time tracking for tasks
   - Create view for showing task hierarchy and dependencies

4. Schema Updates Needed:
   - Add new fields to mindmap_nodes table for task management
   - Consider creating separate task-specific tables for detailed tracking

5. Integration Points:
   - Connect mind map nodes with toit_tasks table
   - Implement real-time updates for task status changes
   - Add task progress visualization in mind map view

### 2024-03-20 (continued)

#### Additional improvements made:
- Refactored mind map update logic to preserve node identity and improve data consistency
- Implemented more efficient node update strategy for better collaboration support

#### Technical debt addressed:
- Fixed potential data loss issue during map saves
- Improved database operation efficiency
- Better support for future real-time collaboration features

#### Next technical steps:
1. Add version control for node updates
2. Implement real-time subscriptions for collaborative editing
3. Add transaction support for related operations
4. Implement node conflict resolution strategy
