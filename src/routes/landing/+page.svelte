                Gentle Productivity
              </h2>
              <p class="mx-auto max-w-[700px] text-muted-foreground md:text-xl/relaxed">
                Split your goals into quick wins and deeper work, connecting them with activities you already enjoy. Progress at your natural rhythm.
                Toit is a productivity system that helps you focus on the present and complete tasks in a balanced way. It's not about speed, it's about completion. In a world that constantly pushes us to do more, faster, and better, Toit emerges as a breath of fresh air in the realm of productivity tools. But Toit isn't just another app vying for your attention in the crowded space of task managers and to-do lists. Instead, it's a paradigm shift in how we approach our daily tasks and long-term goals.

                Toit, at its core, is a playful nod to the phrase "get around to it" - that common refrain we use when speaking of tasks we know we should do, but haven't found the right moment for yet. But rather than treating these tasks as burdens or sources of guilt, Toit transforms them into segments of a circle - a "Round Toit". This visual metaphor is powerful: it reminds us that productivity isn't a linear race to be won, but a cyclical journey to be experienced. Each task, whether it's a quick errand or a deep work session, becomes a vital part of completing our circle.
                
                What sets Toit apart is its embrace of natural rhythms and the ebb and flow of human energy. Unlike traditional productivity tools that often inadvertently promote burnout through their relentless push for efficiency, Toit encourages users to progress at their own pace. It acknowledges that some tasks require time to percolate, others need intense focus, and still others might be quick wins that provide a boost of motivation. By allowing users to visualize their progress as they gradually fill in their Round Toit, the app provides a sense of accomplishment that goes beyond the fleeting satisfaction of crossing items off a list. In essence, Toit isn't just about getting things done - it's about fostering a more mindful, balanced approach to productivity that aligns with our natural cycles of energy and motivation.
