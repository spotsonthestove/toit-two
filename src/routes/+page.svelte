<h1>Welcome to Toit</h1>

<h1> take a bit out of a few things and get a round Toit </h1> 
<h1>  </h1> 

<div id="toit">   
<p>This might help. 

We'll go thorugh a few ideas

Mainly the Toit and how that might help timey-wimey focus.

We'll also go through the three wheel and how that might help with the Toit.

The main thing to explian is that the TOIT is an excuse or a habit to get into a frame of mind

so that we use one of the parts of the toit so as to drive throught the other parts of the toit.\
get into the unenjoy so as to get to the biut that is nice and that might just be washing one window\


habits are part of it

evry task is in the calendar

and every calendar entry has at least three reminders haha
